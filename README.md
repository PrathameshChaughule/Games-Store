# 🎮 Gemaring – Online Game Store Website

A modern **online game store web application** built with **React** that simulates a real-world eCommerce platform with **user and admin roles**, **authentication**, **role-based access control**, **admin-controlled frontend content**, and **complete purchase workflows**.

This project is designed as a **strong frontend portfolio project** and focuses on **realistic workflows, maintainability, and professional UI/UX**.

## 🧠 Key Highlights (Why This Project Stands Out)

* **Real-world eCommerce workflow** (wishlist → order → download)
* **User request → admin approval → catalog update** flow
* **Dynamic admin-controlled landing page** (mini CMS)
* **Authentication with OTP-based email verification**
* **Strict role-based access control**
* **Clean, responsive dark-theme UI**
* **Frontend-focused but system-oriented design**

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

### Frontend

* React.js
* React Router
* Axios
* Tailwind CSS
* Chart library (for admin dashboard analytics)

### Backend (Mock / API Simulation)

* JSON Server (REST APIs)
* Hosted on **Render** for production-like usage
* Used for authentication, users, games, orders, requests, and CMS data

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

* Signup with email verification using OTP
* Login with role-based redirection
* Forgot password with OTP verification via email
* Role-based route protection (User / Admin)
* Admin accounts can only be created by existing admins

> **Note:** Email OTP functionality is implemented as part of authentication flow. Password hashing and backend email services can be integrated in a production setup.

## 🧭 Application Flow

### User Flow

1. Signup → Email verification → Login
2. Browse games → Add to wishlist
3. Add to cart → Place order
4. View order history → Download purchased games
5. Request new games from request page

### Admin Flow

1. Admin login
2. Dashboard overview (revenue + alerts)
3. Review game requests
4. Accept request → Game added to store
5. Manage games, users, and orders
6. Update landing page content dynamically

---

## 📊 Admin Dashboard

* Revenue graph for sales analysis
* Alerts panel for:

  * New game requests
  * Pending actions
  * System updates
* Designed with a **70% analytics / 30% alerts** layout for better usability

---

## 🖥️ Dynamic Frontend Content (CMS-like Feature)

Admins can control key frontend content directly from the dashboard:

* Hero section image and text
* Featured games
* Game news / announcements

Changes reflect immediately on the frontend without redeploying or modifying code.

---

## 🎨 UI / UX Design

* Dark theme tailored for gaming platforms
* Responsive layout for all screen sizes
